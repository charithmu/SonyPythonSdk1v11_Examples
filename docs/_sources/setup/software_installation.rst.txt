Software Installation
=====================

This page will guide you through the setup for adding the sony_cr library to your python project.

For setting up the camera and environment, please read through the `Environment Setup <../_static/rcsdk_api.pdf#page=14>`_ in the API doc.

---------------------------------------------------------


Windows
+++++++

Before setup, please make sure you have `Python3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ installed.
For this software, we recommend 3.11 but other versions will also work.

1. If you don't have `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ installed, please see its documentation for how to install `here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`_.

2. Install drivers for sony cameras. See :doc:`/downloads/downloads`.

3. To run the gui sample code, create a new virtual environment and activate it:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m virtualenv venvs\build

.. code-block:: console

    venvs\build\Scripts\activate

4. Next, use pip install with the appropriate wheel file for your version (with wheel file inside project folder):

.. code-block:: console

    pip install .\sony_cr-1.7.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl


All the wheel files can be found in :doc:`/downloads/downloads`

Ubuntu
++++++

Ubuntu has Python 3 pre-installed however, to make sure that versions are up to date:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt update


Now upgrade any packages that are not up to date:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt -y upgrade

To install the python version of the SDK, you need to install the package manger pip:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt install -y python3-pip

At this point you could install the python SDK, however we recommnd that you install virtual environments to isolate dependencies for different projects:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt install -y python3-venv

Now create a directory for your projects. In this project directory, create a virtual environment by running the following command (.venv can be any name you want):

.. code-block:: console
 
    python3 -m venv .venv

To activate the virtual environment use the following command:

.. code-block:: console
 
   source .venv/bin/activate


Using pip install the python version of the SDK:

.. code-block:: console

    pip3 install sony_cr-1.8.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl

Finnally copy the Camera Remote SDK libraries to /usr/bin

.. code-block:: console

    sudo cp -r CrAdapter libCr_Core.so /usr/bin/
