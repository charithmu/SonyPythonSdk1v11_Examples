Initialise the Camera Library
======================================

The SDK has to be initialised to discover the connected cameras and to start issuing commands or reading parameters. The sample below shows the code required to initialise the library and find any connected cameras.

.. code-block:: python

    import sony_cr
    import io
    import sys
    import time

    cm = sony_cr.CameraManager()

    cameras = cm.find_cameras()

    print("Found {} camera(s)".format(len(cameras)))
    for i, cam in enumerate(cameras):
        print("[{}]: {} {}".format(i+1, cam['model'], cam['id']))
    
    cam = cm.get_camera(cameras[0]['id'])

    cam.connect()
    

If no camera is connected (or PC Remote Function is not on), then "Found 0 camera(s)" will be displayed. If a camera is discovered, it will print out the model of the camera.

In this example, we take the first connected camera and connect().

Using the snippet above, create a find-cameras.py and execute using the command:

.. code-block:: console

    python find-camera.py
