Shutter Release
=====================

The Shutter Release command can be issued on a connected camera using the shutter_down() and shutter_up() methods. 

In the Camera Remote SDK, the API call to issue a command for shutter up/down is `SendCommand <../../_static/rcsdk_api.pdf#page=109>`_ .

Details about the Shutter Release Command can be found at `ShutterRelease <../../_static/rcsdk_api.pdf#page=223>`_

    print("Found {} camera(s)".format(len(cameras)))
    for i, cam in enumerate(cameras):
        print("[{}]: {} {}".format(i+1, cam['model'], cam['id']))
        
    if len(cameras) == 0:
        sys.exit(0)
        
    cam = cm.get_camera(cameras[0]['id'])
