Capture an Image
=================================

Once the camera library has been initialised (see :doc:`../init-library`), you can start issuing commands, setting or getting parameters.

.. code-block:: python

    import sony_cr
    import io
    import sys
    import time

    cm = sony_cr.CameraManager()

    cameras = cm.find_cameras()

    print("Found {} camera(s)".format(len(cameras)))
    for i, cam in enumerate(cameras):
        print("[{}]: {} {}".format(i+1, cam['model'], cam['id']))
        
    if len(cameras) == 0:
        sys.exit(0)
        
    cam = cm.get_camera(cameras[0]['id'])

    cam.connect()

    print("Saving images to ", cam.get_save_folder())

    cam.capture_image(100)

    # wait for the images to be downloaded from the camera
    time.sleep(2)

Connect to the camera using the connect() method. If this is successful, you can call the capture_image() \
method to instruct the camera to take a photo. The capture_image() method takes an argument to wait (in ms) \
for the autofocus before taking the picture. 

Using the snippet above, create a capture-image.py and execute using the command:

.. code-block:: console

    python capture-image.py
